# Cordova-FormattedDeviceInfo

This is a script I use for to display or capture device information.  It formats the response from cordova for various purposes.  I use it to display onto the device for tech support.  Also, I use it to transmit the device information to the server for management.  

To use it, include the following line in the html:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/FormattedDeviceInfo.js"></script> 

In the header of the page add a link to the popup page.  The HTML is located in this repository:

        <a href="#info_dialog" data-transition="fade" data-theme="a" data-icon="info" class="ui-btn-left">About</a>
